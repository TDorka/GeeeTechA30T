# Geeetech A30T Touch Screen

I have a Geeetech A30T printer with a Smartto board (that is what they call it, it's actually labeled *GTM32\_103\_V1*). It comes with a corresponding firmware from Geeetech.

Unfortunately, the software is a little bit crappy in some aspects, e.g. it does not support some commands or supports only a limited subset. Hence, I want to upgrade to Marlin 2.x.

However, I got the information that the touch screen will not work together with the Marlin firmware. Unfortunately I couldn't get Marlin to work as of now, but if I ever do I want to have the touch screen working as well. I really like to switch filaments or do the leveling via the touch screen. Unfortunately, the firmware of the is closed source, hence, I cannot analyze it by looking at the code. The (unfortunately incomplete) Smartto code that is available from Geeetech via Github does not explain much about the communication.

Hence, I want to analyze the communication between the touch screen board and the control board to be able to use it later on together with a version of Marlin.

## General Information

The screen has it's own board (see [picture](./Touch%20screen.JPG)) and is labeled as *"Smartto\_LCD 3.2 VER2.1 FR4 1.6mm 2019-10-31"*.

The main processor is an ARM chip labeled *"STM32F103 VET6"*. This is the same processor as the main board has.

The connector labeled as *J2* seems to be a serial connector as it is connected to the main board via that connector. There are 4 pins and on the main board the pins are labeled *5V*, *RX*, *TX* and *GND* (see [picture](./Touch%20screen%20connector%20on%20main%20board.JPG)). The wires of the cable connecting the two ports are running straight. However, the connectors on each side are inverse to each other (see [picture](./Connection%20cable.JPG)).

I bought three USB to TTL adapters (see [picture](./TTL%20FT232RL%20adapter.JPG)) via the Internet to be able to connect to the touch screen and to also be able to connect to the control board and the touch screen concurrently to "listen in" on the communication that is happening. The adapters have an FT232RL chip, but actually I don't know whether this is really required. There are cheaper ones, but for about 10â‚¬ for all of them the price was OK for me. I use a break-out board that came with my Raspberry Pi to easily connect the adapter with the boards. The adapters are automatically recognized by my Linux Mint system and devices like */dev/ttyUSB0* are created.

In the Geeetech Smartto repository on Github I saw that a serial port is configured to use 115200 baud. I will use that for testing and see whether that works out OK.

In the following, many codes are postfixed with a star and a number, e.g. `*92`. I assume that these are some kind of check sum as they change based on the content of the message. I have to check on whether I can live without them or have to figure out what they do.

## Approach

My approach to see what the communication pattern between the touch screen and the control board is as follows:

1. Connect the touch screen to Linux and see whether the display works at all. If this works out, check all the buttons on the screens and see what output they produce.
2. Connect the control board and the touch screen to the Linux system via two TTL devices. Forward all messages from one device to the other and also record the communication to see what messages are exchanged.
3. Send messages to the touch screen and the control board and see whether the "check sums" are required or not, and if they are, find out, how they can be derived.

## Check 1: connect the touch screen to Linux

First, I unplug the cable from both boards. I connect the TTL adapter with the control board side of the cable. I connect the cables as they are described on the control board. Then, I use the Linux tool *screen* to connect to the TTL device and see what happens. The command I use is:

`sudo screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200,cs8`

Then, I connect the other side of the cable with the display. Luckily, the touch screen starts up right away and in the screen program I can see that the display sends the following string initially:

`log Geeetech LCD OK`

The touch screen is usable and for some actions that I do on the touch screen, message are sent from the display. The results are listed in the following table (`N-0` indicates start of a line, I guess these will normally be counted up if the control board responds):

## Check 2: Listen in on communication between touch screen and control board

I use two TTL devices connected to my Linux system. One connects to the touch screen (as in the section before) and the other one connects to the control board. Hence, I have two devices: `/dev/ttyUSB0` and `/dev/ttyUSB1`. For, it doesn't matter which device is connected to which board as I'm just listening in on the connection and I already know what the messages from the touch screen look like.

I use the tool *"socat"* in Linux to connect the two ports and write two files that contain the communication. The command that I use is

`sudo socat /dev/ttyUSB0,b115200,raw,echo=0 SYSTEM:'tee in.txt |socat - "/dev/ttyUSB1,b115200,raw,echo=0" |tee out.txt'`

This opens the first TTL, sets it to 115200 baud, outputs it to system call that writes the data into the file `in.txt` and forwards the input as well to the second TTL device, setting 115200 baud as well, and captures the output that device into the file `out.txt`. This works out great. The only thing that would be even better is to have a timestamp in the file to see what output from the control board is related to which output from the touch screen.

To do that, I try to change the output of each socket by passing it through the Linux `sed` tool (and some additional magic is required). Hence, my new command is

`sudo socat /dev/ttyUSB0,b115200,raw,echo=0 SYSTEM:'sed -u -E \"s/^(.*)/echo \\\$(date +%T.%N) - \\1/\" | sh | tee in.txt | sed -u \"s/^.*?\-\W//\" | socat - "/dev/ttyUSB1,b115200,raw,echo=0" | tee out-orig.txt | sed -u -E -e \"s/;/#SEMICOLON#/g\" -e \"s/^(.*)/echo \\\$(date +%T.%N) - \\1/\" | sh | tee out.txt | sed -u -e \"s/#SEMICOLON#/;/g\" -e \"s/^.*?\-\W//\"'`

What this does:

1. get the data from the first TTL
2. create a shell command that prepends a timestamp (e.g `echo $(date +%T.%N) - <original message>`)
3. execute the shell command (`sh`) to get the message prepended with the current time (e.g. `15:15:12.123456789 - <original message>`)
4. `tee` the timestamped output into the file `in.txt`
5. remove the timestamp again so that the original message can be sent to the other TTL port
6. send the message to the other port via STDIN with `socat`
7. store the original data in the file `out-orig.txt` for later reference via `tee`
7. replace all semicolons in the output with the text `#SEMICOLON#` (as these would otherwise make trouble with the `sh` tool) and prepare the shell command to prepend the timestamp as above
8. execute `sh` to actually prepend the current timestamp
9. store the timestamped into the file `out.txt`
10. replace the `#SEMICOLON#` markers with actual semicolons again and remove the timestamp
11. data is then sent to the first TTL

The hacky solution with the `sh` command is required as `sed` does not evaluate commands in the replacement part multiple times, so always the same timestamp would be written. However, creating a script to evaluate the timestamp makes it necessary to remove/replace semicolons as they would interfere with the `sh` command. Anyway, the solution works and is good enough to see what is happening when.

### Startup sequence

As already mentioned in the section about the touch screen commands, the first info the touch screen spits out is

`log Geeetech LCD OK`

This seems really to be a log message and I expect that the message is actually logged on the control board if logging is active. Nevertheless, it seems that the message is not required.

When the control board is switched on, it sends out the following messages (I removed the serial number BTW):

The `L21 P0 S0` command is repeated until the touch screen answers with its firmware version. `L1`, `L2` and `L3` seem to be status messages that are sent either regularly (`L3`) or only when something changes. I'll now try to find out what the specific parameters of the messages mean. My findings about the codes and their parameters can be seen in the following two tables.
